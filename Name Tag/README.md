Why are ID selectors a bad idea?
ID selectors are mainly used for js.

What selectors should you prefer when working with CSS?
I like to use class selectors because you can define them in anyway you wont and you cant use it twice.

# Name card questions

Which web event did you hook into to update the display name?
I put in addEventListener, so every time I click the button it updates the name on the name card.

Where in your HTML did you link to your JavaScript file?
I linked it in the body.

Are there better places? What's the best place?
I think the body is the best because if its in the body then it can connect straight to the id tags in the html.

Why is it best practice to store your CSS/JS in external files rather than in your HTML file?
Its best because it makes it so there is alot less code and one page and its easier to not get confused on where its at.
